# radioselector
Simple script to switch between streaming radio channels.

I wrote this script for my Mother-in-law. Its purpose is to turn an old
laptop into a streaming radio machine, on which she can change channels
by simply pressing F1 to F4, and not have to touch anything else at all.

To get it to work, you must assign the F1 to F4 keys (or whichever keys
you want) on your machine to run this script with "1", "2", "3" or "4"
as the only argument depending on which key was pressed.
